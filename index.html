    <td class="tg-031e" colspan="2">Description: The app is a mix of Omegle and Tinder. The idea is to facilitate actual discussion instead of social media screaming. People rarely change their mind by an oppositional fact based response, contrary to popular belief it often enhances those beliefs because it causes them to seek out more data to confirm their beliefs. Debunking facts that the opposite side uses does not change a persons mind because there are enough misleading and incomplete statistics to support almost any position. It also does not help that in most cases rational thought is often a post hoc justification for an intuitive belief instead of a driving mechanism. The picture looks grim when put that way, but there are plenty of examples of people changing their mind on all sorts of topics. The way people usually change their mind is by making personal connections and through that connection changing their intuitions about a topic. This app will try to apply a Social Intuitionism framework to help people change their mind by exposing them with anonymous people that have a different, but adjacent viewpoint on controversial topics.
